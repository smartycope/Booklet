This is a personal project. It shouldn't be too hard for someone else to make one as well, but it's probably going to be lacking in explanations and documentation.

## Hardware
* Raspberry pi 2W (the one with wifi and bluetooth)
* [240x240, 1.3inch IPS LCD display HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/1.3inch-lcd-hat.htm)
* Micro SD card (I'm currently using 4GB, but I want to upgrade that later)
TODO: Add a battery
